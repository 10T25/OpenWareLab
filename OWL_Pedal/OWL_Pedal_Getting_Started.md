# Getting Started with your OWL Pedal

## CONNECTING IT
The OWL Pedal has connections for stereo audio in (right side) and out (left side), and an
expression pedal input (bottom right) on 1⁄4” jacks.
Connections on the rear of the unit are for DC power supply and for micro USB. The OWL Pedal
can be powered from USB or via 9v DC power supply. For optimal performance, we recommend
using a 9v DC power supply, centre negative, providing at least 500mA. Daisy chaining the power
supply with other pedals is not recommended.
There are 6 controls on the pedal:
* 4 x knobs
* 1 x bicolour LED pushbutton
* 1 x stereo true bypass footswitch

## USING IT
When the OWL Pedal is powered on, it starts the first factory patch: `Jot Reverb`. Turn the top four
knobs to adjust the A, B, C and D parameters of the patch. Connect an expression pedal to the
expression pedal input to control the `E` parameter.
The reverse page has a list of 40 installed patches and their parameters. The last four in the list are
user programmable patch slots.
To change patch, press and hold down the LED pushbutton for about 3 seconds until the LED
flashes. Turn the `A` knob to select from 5 banks of patches. Turn the `B` knob to select from 8
patches in each bank. As you turn either knob, each step toggles the LED between green and red.
Our website has a patch library with several dozen additional patches which can be easily loaded
onto the pedal.
